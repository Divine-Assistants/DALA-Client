                          <p className='text-[16px] mb-[40px] md:text-[24px]  '>In my experience as a young person growing up in Africa, one thing has
been constant: there are never enough jobs available for the kids of the
neighbourhood. Many families have toiled to put their children through
elementary, secondary, and tertiary education, and yet even after all of
this, there are never enough jobs for the young. In nations like Nigeria,
where young people are struggling to find work, we have seen a
dramatic surge in fraud. Few retirees among the elderly have sufficient
pension money to support their desire to do so, and those who do are
unlikely to find work in their later years. For a very long period, this has
been a consistent situation throughout Africa.</p>
